# thrust_bearing
Simple analysis of hydrodynamic lubricated thrust bearing. Finite element method. Rotordynamic coefficients.

The parameters are set in the file "ThrustInput.m".

Run "ReyThrustZStiffnessRun.m" to perform the calculation.

This Repo is one of my ansient projects. I was not good at using MATLAB at that time. So, apologies if the code is somehow in such a mess.

And also apology for the non-English comments.
